# GyroCube
Self Balancing Cube Project

Balancing Cube project based on the "remrc" model: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6695891

    Creation of an Application to facilitate calibration and motor testing,
    Merging the main program with the motors test program,
    Creation of a printed circuit for those who wish to have a beautiful object,
    Addition of a Power button,
    Addition of a button to turn on the LEDs and change their colors,
    Modified the face files for placing the switches in 12 and 16mm. Thanks to dinomight.

Added new [BLE firmware](esp32_cube_vBLE_en/) this has a browser based config tool (can be use on android/mac/pc via chrome). The firmware is written to be used with platformio rather than the arduino ide. it may still work the arduino ide but i'm not sure (Platformio is far superior anyways). This firmware is backwards compatible with other app config methods (Bluetooth Serial, Pedro android app). I however think the new BLE tool is superior. I'm a little biased but try it you'll see.
